# NoGems?

![NoGems Logo](report/images/ng_logo.png)

## Overview

**NoGems?** is a multi-platform, persistent, evasive, and mutating malware developed in 24 hours as part of a lab exercise in the **University of Western Australia's CITS3006 Penetration Testing Unit**. The malware is designed to infect both Windows and Debian-based operating systems, demonstrating techniques commonly used by malicious software to achieve persistence, evade detection, and exfiltrate data.

This project is for educational purposes, showcasing how malware can be created and analyzed. The keylogging malware implements basic features, such as establishing persistence, cloning itself, mutating to avoid detection, and securely transmitting captured data to a remote server.

> **Note**: While the code was written within a 24-hour period, the production listener and compiled executables have been
modified slightly to safely exfiltrate to the externally hosted listener, additionally code cleanup and formatting has also been applied to the source code.

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Designed to work on both Windows and Debian-based systems.
- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Modifies system registry (Windows) or creates `systemd` services (Debian-based) to ensure the malware runs on startup.
- **Code Mutation**: Each execution results in the malware cloning itself to a new location with slight modifications, making it harder to detect.
- **Keylogging**: Captures keystrokes and exfiltrates them to a remote server using HTTPS.
- **User Notification**: Informs the user that their system has been compromised after every ten keystrokes (demonstration purpose).

## General Lifecycle

1. **Initial Distribution**: Social engineering techniques lure users into downloading the malware, disguised as a tool for obtaining free in-game resources.
2. **Execution**: The malware checks for privileges, clones itself, mutates to avoid detection, and sets up mechanisms to run on startup.
3. **Obfuscation and Mutation**: The code is obfuscated using PyArmor, and the executable is bundled with PyInstaller.
4. **Persistence Mechanisms**: The malware modifies system settings to ensure it runs every time the system is restarted.
5. **Keylogging and Data Exfiltration**: Captured keystrokes are securely sent to a remote server.
6. **User Notification**: Alerts the user that their keystrokes are being logged.
7. **Self-Destruction**: The original file is deleted after cloning to minimize traces of the malware.
8. **Reinjection into Startup**: The malware re-adds itself to the startup sequence every time it runs.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
- **Virtual environment** (recommended).
- **PyArmor** for code obfuscation.
- **PyInstaller** for bundling the application.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nogems.git
   cd nogems

### Security Note

The production listener and compiled executables are modified to include security features such as authentication tokens, ensuring that they are not trivially exploitable. These modifications ensure the safety and ethical use of this demonstration project.
